title: "How to Deploy a Django Project on Heroku"
description: "Heroku is a cloud platform where you can deploy, manage and scale your applications. Heroku is fully managed meaning you don't have to care about maintaining your infrastructure which enhances developer productivity. It supports most of the mainstream programming languages so depending on your project you're likely sorted. It also supports multiple third-party add-ons which make scaling your application easier. In this article, I go over how to deploy a Django application on Heroku."

<h2> Deploying a Django Project on Heroku</h2>

This article assumes that you're familiar with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" className="text-blue-400">Django</a> and have possibly worked with <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/" className="text-blue-400">Django REST Framework</a>. This is in no way a comprehensive guide on deploying applications on Heroku but a quick guide to just the necessary bits to have your app up and running. I'll try as much as possible to provide links to resources that further discuss the concepts covered. The article also assumes familiarity with [git](https://git-scm.com/) as a version control system. The article also assumes that you have Python installed on your operating system.

In this tutorial you'll learn the following concepts:

<ul className="list-disc">
  <li>Making releases to your applications using git.</li>
  <li>
    Managing environment variables both locally on your development code and in
    production.
  </li>
  <li>Connecting your application to Postgres as a Heroku add-on.</li>
  <li>
    Working with `django-on-heroku` package to handle configs for you in your
    `settings.py` file.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 className="text-3xl">Creating a Heroku Account</h2>

The first step would be to sign up for a Heroku account that you will be using to
host your application. Heroku offers several tiers for different use cases therefore
you are certain to find a package that works perfectly for your project needs. For
the tutorial, I'll use the basic package offering eco dynos that allow you to host
multiple projects within the same plan. The way eco dynos have is you get 1000 eco
dyno hours that you can use within a month for just $5. When an application hasn't
been used for more than 30 minutes then the eco dynos sleep meaning the time the
dynos are asleep the hours won't be accrued towards your total dyno hours. For the
next hit to your application, it will take a slightly longer time than it would take
since the dynos have to be spun up before accessing the resources. It is also important
to note that the eco dyno hours will renew at the start of each month.

To proceed, head over to [Heroku's sign-up page](https://signup.heroku.com/) and follow all the prompts to complete your sign-up process. Next, you'll want to add a payment method and subscribe to the 1000 eco dyno hours pool for $5. The following [article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/eco-dyno-hours#subscribing-to-the-eco-dynos-plan) goes into more detail about how the eco dynos operate and how to subscribe. Once this is done, you can move to the next step where we'll be working with the Heroku CLI tool to manage all our operations within the terminal. Working over the terminal makes it easy for us to carry out all our deployment activities at a centralized place within our repository.

<h2>Installing Heroku CLI and Log In to your Account</h2>
To get started with installing the Heroku CLI tool, you need git installed on your
computer. You can install the Heroku CLI as a standalone installation with the tarball
using the following command. The advantage of using this method is that it auto-updates
which makes it convenient to work with the CLI as you don't have to worry about manually
updating each time you use the CLI tool.

```bash
curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.s | sh
```

For instances where auto-updating isn't ideal, you can use npm to install
a specific version of the CLI tool. Using npm will require having Node installed
on your computer. The following [article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) goes into more detail on all the various ways you can install the CLI tool on your computer.
