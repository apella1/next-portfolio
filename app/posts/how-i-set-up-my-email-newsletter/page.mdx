<h1>How I set up my email newsletter</h1>

<section className="flex flex-col space-y-3">
<p>
  I had always wondered how one sets up a custom email address but never knew
  where to start from to learn the information I needed in order to understand
  what went on behind the scenes. This remained as one of those things I wanted
  to do but never really got started on. This is until recently. I became more
  fascinated with computer networking, and that led me to taking a Udemy course
  on computer networking by Rick Crisci, which sparked more interest as the last
  time I read anything about networking was a while back when I did my
  undergraduate in Mathematics and Computer Science. After building more
  confidence with the computer networking fundamentals, I started looking for
  something to build on top of to get some practice. I did a couple of network
  subnetting on paper as that was the natural next step for me to practice more.
  I extended this learning to Google Cloud Platform where I found my new
  learnings very useful. This began from creating my first VPC, a Compute Engine
  instance, load balancing across managed and unmanaged instance groups,
  enabling firewall rules across specific subnets used internally by Google
  Cloud Platform and working with Google Kubernetes Engine, just to mention a
  few technologies I found fascinating in my first interactions. This was done
  through the [Google Cloud Skills Boost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/)
  platform which had labs that were beginner focused and slowly progressed in
  difficulty to keep the learning challenging but still manageable to walk
  through. I picked the Cloud Engineer learning path that I worked through and
  registered for the [Google Associate Cloud
  Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-engineer)
  certification which I achieved after my practice time. I'm looking forward to
  expanding my skills in the cloud and gearing more towards site reliability
  engineering which has been growingly becoming fascinating to me, thanks to the
  leanings and amazing stories from the [Google SRE
  Podcast](https://sre.google/prodcast/).

  Now I'll get to the newsletter. Borrowing from how I found the labs from Cloud
  Skills Boost effective for my learning, I was thinking of a way to master the
  fundamentals around cloud technologies that was agnostic to the cloud
  providers and that one would easily build on top of to any platform they
  wanted, be it AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean or any other cloud provider, and
  that involved some sought of labs that would be easy to set up. That's when I
  thought it great to start a newsletter just around that. This would allow me
  to work on the labs to improve my learning whilst sharing that with the
  broader community. This can allow people on the same journey as I am to
  benefit from this while also challenging my approaches and helping build on
  the learning. From this point, I had to stop wondering and do the reading. I
  already had a custom domain (johnapella.com), and building from the first
  principles thought, "How would I get labs@johnapella.com to send my newsletter
  from?". That lead to me AWS Simple Email Service and AWS Workmail. I went
  through their setup instructions, created an identity around my domain and
  verified that on my DNS provider. This involved a lot of verifications and
  setups to improve email deliverability, a new realm that I was quick learning
  the basics of. I then proceeded to create the `labs` user in Workmail to
  finally get the email I wanted. Then I had to have a place from which I could
  manage my email list. Did some research and settled with Email Octopus Connect
  due to its interoperability with AWS Simple Email Service. Email Octopus, too,
  has its own learnings that I need to get familiar with. This leaves me with a
  lot of learning as I keep on builing on the cloud and around cloud
  technologies and working to improve on the quality of the labs even as I look
  to send my first lab out to learners like me. This might have already happened
  depending on when you're reading this.

  This was just a short piece to share a bit about my journey and my motivations
  for starting my newsletter and to keep exploring my interests around site
  reliability engineering.
