<h1>How I Set Up my Email Newsletter</h1>

<section>
    <p>
        I had always wondered how one sets up a custom email address but never knew
        where to start to learn the information I needed to understand
        what went on behind the scenes. This remained one of those things I wanted
        to do but never really got started on, until recently. I became more
        fascinated with computer networking, and that led me to taking a Udemy course
        on computer networking by Rick Crisci, which sparked more interest as the last
        time I read anything about networking was a while back when I did my
        undergraduate in Mathematics and Computer Science. After building more
        confidence with the computer networking fundamentals, I started looking for
        something to build on top of to get some practice. I did a couple of network
        subnetting exercises on paper as that was the natural next step for me to practice more.

        I extended this learning to Google Cloud Platform where I found my new
        learnings very useful. This began with creating my first VPC, a Compute Engine
        instance, load balancing across managed and unmanaged instance groups,
        enabling firewall rules across specific subnets used internally by Google
        Cloud Platform and working with Google Kubernetes Engine, just to mention a
        few technologies I found fascinating in my first interactions. This was done
        through the [Google Cloud Skills Boost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/)
        platform which had labs that were beginner-focused and that slowly progressed
        in difficulty to keep the learning challenging but still manageable to walk
        through. I picked the Cloud Engineer learning path that I worked through and
        registered for the [Google Associate Cloud
        Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-engineer)
        certification which I achieved after my practice time. I'm looking forward to
        expanding my skills in the cloud and gearing more towards site reliability
        engineering which has been growingly becoming fascinating to me, thanks to the
        learnings and amazing stories from the [Google SRE
        Podcast](https://sre.google/prodcast/).

        Now I'll get to the newsletter. Borrowing from how I found the labs from Cloud
        Skills Boost effective for my learning, I was thinking of a way to master the
        fundamentals around cloud technologies that was agnostic to the cloud
        providers and that one would easily build on top of to any platform they
        wanted, be it AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean or any other cloud provider, and
        that involved some sort of labs that would be easy to set up. That's when I
        thought it would be great to start a newsletter just around that. This would
        allow me to work on the labs to improve my learning whilst sharing that with
        the broader community. This can allow people on the same journey as I am to
        benefit from this while also challenging my approaches and helping build on
        the learning. From this point, I had to stop wondering and do the reading. I
        already had a custom domain (johnapella.com), and building from first
        principles, I thought, "How would I get labs@johnapella.com to send my
        newsletter from?".

        That led me to AWS Simple Email Service and AWS Workmail. I went through their
        setup instructions, created an identity around my domain and verified that on
        my DNS provider. This involved a lot of verifications and setups to improve
        email deliverability, a new realm where I was quickly learning the basics. I
        then proceeded to create the `labs` user in Workmail to finally get the email
        I wanted. Then I had to have a place from which I could manage my email list.
        I did some research and settled with Email Octopus Connect due to its
        interoperability with AWS Simple Email Service. Email Octopus, too, had its
        own learning curve that I needed to get familiar with. This leaves me with a
        lot to learn as I keep on building on the cloud and around cloud technologies
        and working to improve on the quality of the labs even as I look to send my
        first lab out to learners like me. This might have already happened depending
        on when you're reading this.

        This piece was a short glimpse into my journey and the motivations behind starting my newsletter. My goal is to
        keep exploring my interests in site reliability engineering and share what I learn along the way. If this sounds
        interesting to you, I invite you to subscribe and join me on this journey.
